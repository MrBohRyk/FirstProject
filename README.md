# My C++ Learning Journey 🚀

---

## 🟢 Day 1 — First Steps & Console Output
- Launched my first C++ program in Visual Studio
- Set up console output in UTF-8 using `SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)`
- Printed text with and without line breaks using `std::cout`
- Used both English and Ukrainian in the console
- Learned how to use escape sequences like `\n` and `std::endl`
- Added my first comments in code
- Pushed my first commit to GitHub 🎉

---

## 🟢 Day 2 — Variables & Data Types
- Declared and reassigned integer variables (`int`)
- Read user input with `std::cin`
- Printed user input and performed basic math operations (like `a + b`)
- Learned about data types:
  - `short`, `int`, `long`
  - `unsigned short`, `unsigned int`, `unsigned long`
  - `float`, `double`
  - `char`
  - `bool`
- Understood how each type works, how much memory it uses, and its value range
- Structured code with meaningful comments
- Started organizing learning into days

### ✅ Day 2 Bonus – GitHub & Project Structuring
- Learned how to create and format a `README.md`
- Figured out where to place `README.md` so it appears on the main GitHub page
- Resolved my first **merge conflict** like a real developer 🛠️
- Committed and pushed changes from Visual Studio to GitHub
- Understood how Git works with project folders and files

## 🟢 Day 3 — Conditional Logic & Control Flow
- Used `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to compare values
- Compared user input against specific values (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to 3)
- Practiced using relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Checked if a number is **even** or **odd** using the modulus operator (`%`)
- Applied **logical operators**:
  - `&&` (AND)
  - `||` (OR)
  - `!` (NOT)
- Combined logical conditions to check if values fall within a certain range
- Used `bool` variables to control program logic (e.g., `is_has_car`)
- Practiced negation and compound conditions like `!is_has_car || num <= 0`
- Implemented a `switch` statement to output messages based on the value of a variable
- Understood the difference between **assignment (`=`)** and **comparison (`==`)**
- Continued commenting code clearly to describe what each block does

### ✅ Day 3 Bonus – Clean Code & Boolean Thinking
- Created a simple calculator that performs basic math operations based on user input
- Used `switch` to handle operators like `+, -, *,` and `/`
- Practiced combining `int` and `char` inputs for flexible logic
- Improved confidence in working with multiple input types and branching logic
- Strengthened understanding of how user input controls program behavior
