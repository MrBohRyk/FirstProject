# My C++ Learning Journey 🚀

## 🟢 Day 1 — First Steps & Console Output
- Launched my first C++ program in Visual Studio
- Set up console output in UTF-8 using `SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)`
- Printed text with and without line breaks using `std::cout`
- Used both English and Ukrainian in the console
- Learned how to use escape sequences like `\n` and `std::endl`
- Added my first comments in code
- Pushed my first commit to GitHub 🎉

## 🟢 Day 2 — Variables & Data Types
- Declared and reassigned integer variables (`int`)
- Read user input with `std::cin`
- Printed user input and performed basic math operations (like `a + b`)
- Learned about data types:
  - `short`, `int`, `long`
  - `unsigned short`, `unsigned int`, `unsigned long`
  - `float`, `double`
  - `char`
  - `bool`
- Understood how each type works, how much memory it uses, and its value range
- Structured code with meaningful comments
- Started organizing learning into days
